## Project Details

### Project Objective

The objective of the Mid-Project is to explore the relationship between the 3 biggest stock markets in the US and various assets. The project aims to analyze asset prices, daily volatility, and daily returns, and conduct hypothesis tests to compare different assets.

### Building our Dataframe

To create the database for the Mid-Project analysis, historical data for a selection of assets was extracted from Yahoo Finance. The assets include stock market indexes, currencies, rates, and commodities.

Using the provided ticker symbols, data was downloaded for each asset within a specific date range. A new column called "ticker" was added to identify the data associated with each asset.

All the individual dataframes were then combined into a single dataframe, resulting in a comprehensive database for further analysis.

- New York Stock Exchange NYSE (^NYA)
- Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC)
